@article{ScokaertRawlings:1998,
	abstract = {This paper is a contribution to the theory of the infinite-horizon linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem subject to inequality constraints on the inputs and states, extending an approach first proposed by Sznaier and Damborg [16]. A solution algorithm is presented, which requires solving a finite number of finite-dimensional positive definite quadratic programs. The constrained LQR outlined does not feature the undesirable mismatch between open-loop and closed-loop nominal system trajectories, which is present in the other popular forms of model predictive control (MPC) that can be implemented with a finite quadratic programming algorithm. The constrained LQR is shown to be both optimal and stabilizing. The solution algorithm is guaranteed to terminate in finite time with a computational cost that has a reasonable upper bound compared to the minimal cost for computing the optimal solution. Inherent to the approach is the removal of a tuning parameter, the control horizon, which is present in other MPC approaches and for which no reliable tuning guidelines are available. Two examples are presented that compare constrained LQR and two other popular forms of MPC. The examples demonstrate that constrained LQR achieves significantly better performance than the other forms of MPC on some plants, and the computational cost is not prohibitive for online implementation.},

@article{Thangaveletal:2018,
	abstract = {Dual control seeks to explicitly deal with the trade-off between the excitation of the controlled system by probing actions, which lead to a more accurate estimation of the unknown parameters of the plant model, and performance (set-point tracking, economic optimality, etc.) of the controlled system under the imperfect knowledge of the plant behavior. This paper presents a dual-control approach that extends a nonlinear model predictive controller, the control actions of which are robust against the effect of model uncertainties. The robustness is achieved via the multi-stage approach that uses a scenario-tree representation of the propagation of the uncertainties over the prediction horizon of the controller and includes the adaptation of the control actions on the basis of the information that is gained in the future in the optimization problem. The dual-control aspect of the proposed scheme is realized via the direct consideration of the reduction of the range of the parameter uncertainty that is predicted as a result of the parameter estimation using the future measurements. This implicit dual-control mechanism does not require a-priori tuning with respect to the relative importance of the probing actions against the optimal operation of the system, as proposed in other recent approaches. The results from a reactor control example show the advantage of using Dual Multi-stage NMPC over its robust adaptive counterpart, where the reduction of the uncertainty is not predicted and optimized, but only obtained a posteriori when the measurements have arrived.},

@article{Bemporadetal:2002,
	abstract = {For discrete-time linear time invariant systems with constraints on inputs and states, we develop an algorithm to determine explicitly, the state feedback control law which minimizes a quadratic performance criterion. We show that the control law is piece-wise linear and continuous for both the finite horizon problem (model predictive control) and the usual infinite time measure (constrained linear quadratic regulation). Thus, the on-line control computation reduces to the simple evaluation of an explicitly defined piecewise linear function. By computing the inherent underlying controller structure, we also solve the equivalent of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation for discrete-time linear constrained systems. Control based on on-line optimization has long been recognized as a superior alternative for constrained systems. The technique proposed in this paper is attractive fora wide range of practical problems where the computational complexity of on-line optimization is prohibitive. It also provides an insight into the structure underlying optimization-based controllers. {\copyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Joosetal:2013,
	abstract = {Abstract. The responses of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other climate variables to an emission pulse of CO2 into the atmosphere are often used to compute the Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Global Temperature change Potential (GTP), to characterize the response timescales of Earth System models, and to build reduced-form models. In this carbon cycle-climate model intercomparison project, which spans the full model hierarchy, we quantify responses to emission pulses of different magnitudes injected under different conditions. The CO2 response shows the known rapid decline in the first few decades followed by a millennium-scale tail. For a 100 Gt-C emission pulse added to a constant CO2 concentration of 389 ppm, 25 $\pm$ 9% is still found in the atmosphere after 1000 yr; the ocean has absorbed 59 $\pm$ 12% and the land the remainder (16 $\pm$ 14%). The response in global mean surface air temperature is an increase by 0.20 $\pm$ 0.12 $\,^{\circ}$C within the first twenty years; thereafter and until year 1000, temperature decreases only slightly, whereas ocean heat content and sea level continue to rise. Our best estimate for the Absolute Global Warming Potential, given by the time-integrated response in CO2 at year 100 multiplied by its radiative efficiency, is 92.5 × 10&minus;15 yr W m−2 per kg-CO2. This value very likely (5 to 95% confidence) lies within the range of (68 to 117) × 10&minus;15 yr W m−2 per kg-CO2. Estimates for time-integrated response in CO2 published in the IPCC First, Second, and Fourth Assessment and our multi-model best estimate all agree within 15% during the first 100 yr. The integrated CO2 response, normalized by the pulse size, is lower for pre-industrial conditions, compared to present day, and lower for smaller pulses than larger pulses. In contrast, the response in temperature, sea level and ocean heat content is less sensitive to these choices. Although, choices in pulse size, background concentration, and model lead to uncertainties, the most important and subjective choice to determine AGWP of CO2 and GWP is the time horizon.},

@article{BurgessCostaOlken:2017,
	abstract = {Tropical deforestation is one of the major drivers of climate change. Much of this loss is due to illegal logging. Unlike forests in the Congo basin and South-East Asia, the world's largest tropical forest -the Amazon -has experienced a dramatic slowing in rates of deforestation over the last decade. The bulk of the Amazon is located in Brazil which has introduced a raft of policies to reduce illegal logging in recent years. We use Brazil's border with its neighbors to identify the impact of Brazilian policies on deforestation. Because forests are a fixed resource and geography and infrastructure vary continuously over the border we can compare annual forest loss on either side of the border to tease out the impact of national forest policies from other drivers of deforestation. To do this we employ a satellite-derived data set that measures forest cover at a 30 x 30 meter resolution for the entire Amazon area across the 2000-2014 period. Our data reveals a sharp discontinuity at the border -- in 2000 Amazonian pixels on the Brazilian side of the border are more likely to have been deforested and between 2001 and 2005 annual forest loss in Brazil was around four times the rate on the other side of the border. However, in 2006, just after the Brazilian government introduced a raft of policies to curtail illegal logging, these differences disappear and Brazilian rates of forest loss fall to those observed across the border. These results demonstrate the power of the state to affect whether or not natural resources are conserved or exploited even in the furthest reaches of the Amazonian jungle.},

The UN Convention on Climate Change is considering its inclusion in future agreements and asked its scientific board to study methodological and scientific issues related to positive incentives to reduce emissions from deforestation. Here we present an empirically derived mechanism that offers a mix of incentives to developing countries to reduce emissions from deforestation, conserve and possibly enhance their ecosystem's carbon stocks. We also use recent data to model its effects on the 20 most forested developing countries. Results show that at low CO2 prices (∼US$ 8/t CO2) a successful mechanism could reduce more than 90% of global deforestation at an annual cost of US$ 30 billion. {\copyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{mapbiomas,
	abstract = {Brazil has a monitoring system to track annual forest conversion in the Amazon and most recently to monitor the Cerrado biome. However, there is still a gap of annual land use and land cover (LULC) information in all Brazilian biomes in the country. Existing countrywide efforts to map land use and land cover lack regularly updates and high spatial resolution time-series data to better understand historical land use and land cover dynamics, and the subsequent impacts in the country biomes. In this study, we described a novel approach and the results achieved by a multi-disciplinary network called MapBiomas to reconstruct annual land use and land cover information between 1985 and 2017 for Brazil, based on random forest applied to Landsat archive using Google Earth Engine. We mapped five major classes: forest, non-forest natural formation, farming, non-vegetated areas, and water. These classes were broken into two sub-classification levels leading to the most comprehensive and detailed mapping for the country at a 30 m pixel resolution. The average overall accuracy of the land use and land cover time-series, based on a stratified random sample of 75,000 pixel locations, was 89\% ranging from 73 to 95\% in the biomes. The 33 years of LULC change data series revealed that Brazil lost 71 Mha of natural vegetation, mostly to cattle ranching and agriculture activities. Pasture expanded by 46\% from 1985 to 2017, and agriculture by 172\%, mostly replacing old pasture fields. We also identified that 86 Mha of the converted native vegetation was undergoing some level of regrowth. Several applications of the MapBiomas dataset are underway, suggesting that reconstructing historical land use and land cover change maps is useful for advancing the science and to guide social, economic and environmental policy decision-making processes in Brazil.},

@article{Floresetal:2024,
	abstract = {The possibility that the Amazon forest system could soon reach a tipping point, inducing large-scale collapse, has raised global concern1--3. For 65 million years, Amazonian forests remained relatively resilient to climatic variability. Now, the region is increasingly exposed to unprecedented stress from warming temperatures, extreme droughts, deforestation and fires, even in central and remote parts of the system1. Long existing feedbacks between the forest and environmental conditions are being replaced by novel feedbacks that modify ecosystem resilience, increasing the risk of critical transition. Here we analyse existing evidence for five major drivers of water stress on Amazonian forests, as well as potential critical thresholds of those drivers that, if crossed, could trigger local, regional or even biome-wide forest collapse. By combining spatial information on various disturbances, we estimate that by 2050, 10{\%} to 47{\%} of Amazonian forests will be exposed to compounding disturbances that may trigger unexpected ecosystem transitions and potentially exacerbate regional climate change. Using examples of disturbed forests across the Amazon, we identify the three most plausible ecosystem trajectories, involving different feedbacks and environmental conditions. We discuss how the inherent complexity of the Amazon adds uncertainty about future dynamics, but also reveals opportunities for action. Keeping the Amazon forest resilient in the Anthropocene will depend on a combination of local efforts to end deforestation and degradation and to expand restoration, with global efforts to stop greenhouse gas emissions.},

The function u represents the decision maker's risk attitudes, while the index c captures his ambiguity attitudes.

	abstract = {This chapter presents a Markov chain Monte Carlo implementation of Bayesian learning for neural networks in which network parameters are updated using the hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm, a form of the Metropolis algorithm in which candidate states are found by means of dynamical simulation. Hyperparameters are updated separately using Gibbs sampling, allowing their values to be used in chosing good stepsizes for the discretized dynamics. I show that hybrid Monte Carlo performs better than simple Metropolis,due to its avoidance of random walk behaviour. I also discuss variants of hybrid Monte Carlo in which dynamical computations are done using ``partial gradients'', in which acceptance is based on a ``window'' of states,and in which momentum updates incorporate ``persistence''.},
