{cite:t}`griscom2017natural` identify and quantify "natural climate solutions"
(NCS), which include tropical forests. {cite:t}`heinrich2021large` focus on the
potential of the Brazilian Amazon. As noted by {cite:t}`balboni2022economics`,
most studies on agricultural expansion and deforestation are static.

A recent branch of the literature uses discrete-choice models in order
to study the link between agriculture and deforestation
({cite:t}`souza2019deforestation`, {cite:t}`dominguez2021efficiency`,
{cite:t}`araujo2022efficient`). {cite:t}`souza2019deforestation` and
{cite:t}`dominguez2021efficiency` develop static approaches, emphasizing the
role of the transportation network and trade in the design of policies,
without explicitly modeling the carbon cycles associated with the
forest. {cite:t}`araujo2022efficient`, on the other hand, present a dynamic
model along the lines of {cite:t}`scott2014dynamic`, allowing farmers to
internalize the social value of carbon. However, the dynamics in
{cite:t}`araujo2022efficient` are restricted to the forward-looking behavior of
farmers.

In contrast to the existing literature, our dynamic approach not only
accounts for how expected future prices of agricultural goods influence
optimal current land use, it also incorporates carbon emissions from
deforestation and carbon capture from forest regeneration. The carbon
cycle associated with abandoning agriculture and allowing forests to
regrow naturally is considered explicitly in the model. In contrast, the
simulation of carbon prices in {cite:t}`souza2019deforestation` works as a tax
to the expansion of agriculture into forests and it is not associated
with the carbon cycle directly. Consequently, we provide a framework
that integrates the impact of carbon prices on deforestation, forest
restoration, and agriculture. In addition, we also take into account the
uncertainty of the forest carbon measures.

Finally, our results contribute to the literature on climate policy
design. Our simulation shows that deforestation in the Amazon will cross
the tipping point of $20-25\%$ suggested by {cite:t}`lovejoy2018` in the
scenario with carbon price equal to the shadow emission price elicited
from the 1995-2008 period with no additional international payments.[^2]
On the other hand, additional payments of at least \$15/ton would not
only safeguard the tipping point, but would also trigger forest
restoration on a large scale. In this sense, the carbon sink potential
of secondary forests emphasized by {cite:t}`griscom2017natural` and
{cite:t}`heinrich2021large` can be realized with sufficient additional carbon
payments.
