We used a rich data set to study the impact of carbon prices on optimal
forest preservation over time and space in the Brazilian Amazon. We
produced results for three exercises. First, we project out the
implications of "business-as-usual" for land allocation in the Brazilian
amazon by deducing the shadow price for emissions that would justify
historical deforestation. When we impose this shadow price looking
forward, the implied land allocation we find that the resulting
deforestation would eventually threaten the survival of the Amazon as a
tropical forest. Second, we explore implications of augmenting this
shadow price with transfer payments. We find that transfer prices as low
as \$15 per ton of C0$_2$e lead to a substantial net reforestation and
carbon capture in an efficient dynamic spatial land allocation.
Furthermore, a time invariant carbon price of $\$25$ would generate
enough monetary transfers to fully compensate Brazil for the loss of
output in the reforested areas. As a third exercise we consider the
impact of robustly optimal controls on the spatial outcomes when the
capacity of each site to capture carbon as well as agricultural
productivity is uncertain to the planner.

Our results suggest international carbon payments of \$25 USD/ton can
reduce emissions by about 20GtCO2e in 15 years and by about 30 GtCO2e,
in 30 years. This amount represents not only the total GtCO2e of carbon
captured by natural regeneration, for which Brazil will receive
payments, but the avoided emissions from deforestation that would happen
in the "business-as-usual" scenario. According to {cite:t}`griscom2017natural`,
nature-based solutions such as forest restoration, avoided land
conversion, forest management and other practices have the potential of
capturing about 11.3 Gt of CO2 per year globally with costs no greater
than \$100 USD/ton. Our baseline simulation in
{ref}`tab:transferCost_1043sites_det` suggests that optimal
management of the Brazilian Amazon can deliver about 10% of this total
at a much lower effective cost.

Our calculations in this paper ignore some important costs of
deforestation. We do not include, for instance, the effect of
deforestation on agricultural productivity in the Amazon
({cite:t}`leite2021deforestation`) or in other regions in Brazil, a country
that is currently the fourth largest agricultural producer and third
largest exporter in the world. We also do not take into account the loss
of biodiversity or resiliency including the possibility that Amazon
deforestation triggers a tipping point with broad based consequences
({cite:t}`steffen2018trajectories` and {cite:t}`Floresetal:2024`). Finally, we do not
account for the direct effect of deforestation in one site on forests in
other sites.[^2] These are important considerations for future research.
