In this section, we report our quantitative findings. We start by
constructing a benchmark "business-as-usual" set of results. We
accomplish this by deducing an implied social price of carbon that
supports current aggregate implications. Then, in succession, we study
i) deterministic solutions for higher social prices; ii) stochastic
solutions with price randomness; and iii) solutions with parameter
uncertainty.
