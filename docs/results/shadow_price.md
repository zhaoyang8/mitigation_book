## Shadow prices under business-as-usual

<hr style="height:4px; background-color:black; border:none;">

<br>

We infer a *shadow* value for the planner based on historical
experience. To obtain this value, we first choose an interval
$[\underline t,  \bar t]$ and then select a time invariant price for
emissions, denoted by $P^{ee},$ to match the aggregate deforestation
predicted by the model at a final observation period $\bar t.$ We let
$(X_{\underline t}^o, Z_{\underline t}^o)$ denote the initial observed
state vector. We also input the realized history of agricultural prices
$\{P^a_t: {\underline t}\le t \le {\bar t}\}.$ We then compute the
optimal trajectory for the state variables implied by our model for
alternative choices of $P^{ee}$ and find the choice of $P^{ee}$ that
matches the observed value of the aggregate deforestation at $\bar t$
:[^2] $\sum_{i=1}^I Z_{\bar t}^i.$

We use $\underline t=1995,$ the initial date for our price data and
$\bar t = 2008$ the announcement of the Amazon fund that would pay for
preservation projects in the Amazon, using money contributed mostly by
Norway.

The business-as-usual price, $P^{ee},$ depends on the model
specifications, as we document in Table
{ref}`tab:shadow_price`. For instance, since an increase in the
agricultural price makes cattle farming more productive, the
business-as-usual carbon price has to increase to achieve the same
deforestation outcome. Also, with more sites at a finer resolution, some
of the smaller sites will have agricultural productivities that are
relatively higher, increasing the incentive to deforest. As Table 
{ref}`tab:shadow_price` shows, the business-as-usual price is
larger when we have a finer partition of sites. Finally, uncertainty in
the productivity parameters leads to a smaller business-as-usual price
for reasons that will become clear in our subsequent discussion. In what
follows, we will consider solutions to the optimization problem starting
in 2017 and a discount rate of 2 percent.

We will explore implications when the planner uses $P^e=P^{ee}+b$ for
$b=0, 10,15, 20,$ and $25$ where $b$ represents transfers per ton of
*net* captured emissions to the planner. Specifically, when net
emissions total $E$ tons of CO$_2,$ the planner receives a transfer of
$bE$. Note that even $b=25$ corresponds to a social price that is low
when compared to the prevailing price of emissions in some regions of
the globe. The forces that lead to changes in shadow prices have a
direct and partially offsetting effect on deforestation. Consequently,
the implied optimal (or robustly optimal) trajectories for each choice
of $b$ will be less sensitive to the particular model specification.
Essentially, the same argument applies to changes in the subjective
discount rate.[^3]

[^2]: We obtain a similar value if instead we minimize the norm of the
    vector
    $(\frac{X_{\bar t} - X^o_{\bar t}}{X^o_{\bar t}}, \frac{Z_{\bar t} - Z^o_{\bar t}}{Z^o_{\bar t}})$,

[^3]: Since emissions are a low duration asset relative to cattle, a
    larger discount rate implies less deforesting, thus lowering
    $P^{ee}$, approximating future trajectories for a given $b.$ In
    fact, our simulations show that future trajectories do not change
    much for each $b,$ when we move from 2 to 3 percent.
