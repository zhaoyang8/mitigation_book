## Solution with parameter ambiguity neutrality

In the absence of stochastic prices and with ambiguity neutrality, we
solve a static optimization problem over all possible trajectories for
the next 200 years for 1043 sites. This problem is deterministic
evaluated at the *ex-ante* average parameters using baseline
distributions. Given obvious uniform bounds on possible utility flows
and discount rates of at least 2%, the resulting trajectories give
reasonable approximations to the infinite horizon optima.
