    "subjective ambiguity from the standpoint of the social planner by making\n",
    "a model-determined robustness adjustment to the subjective probabilities\n",
    "for the unknown parameters. We are once again pushed to use a numerical\n",
    "method, in this case a Markov chain Monte Carlo method based on\n",
    "Hamiltonian dynamics. Such a method is particularly valuable for\n",
    "high-dimensional problems and has substantial advantages over the\n",
    "familiar Metropolis-Hastings approach. We use the Hamiltonian Markov\n",
    "chain approach in a novel way to confront what is sometimes referred to\n",
    "as “deep uncertainty” about productivity parameters. Alternatively, we\n",
    "may interpret this treatment of subjective ambiguity as a robust\n",

    "To set the stage for our analysis, we use the model to elicit an\n",
    "estimate of the shadow price for emissions revealed by the deforestation\n",
    "during 1995-2008. The year 1995 is the first date at which we have\n",
    "reliable price data on cattle prices.[^2] The year 2008 marks the\n",
    "beginning of the Amazon Fund, financed primarily by the Norwegian and\n",
    "German governments.[^3] We use the inferred shadow price for simulations\n",
    "designed to capture “business-as-usual.” We also use this shadow price\n",
    "to measure the value for Brazilians of the “forest services” provided by\n",
    "preserved areas. These services include climate services as well as the\n",
    "economic value of production that occurs without destroying the Amazon\n",
    "forest.[^4]\n",

    "We study the impact of adding outside payments for *net* capture of\n",
    "CO$_2$ in the Amazon. We produce results in three steps. In step one, we\n",
    "construct the finest grid by considering 1043 sites in the Amazon biome\n",
    "with each measuring 67.5km$\\times$ 67.5km. For this level of detail, we\n",
    "produce results without accounting for uncertainty in the price of\n",
    "agricultural output. Instead, we impose that the price corresponds to\n",
    "the (stationary) average of the two-state Markov process we fit to the\n",
    "observed agricultural prices. We also use these deterministic solutions\n",
    "to ascertain whether and by how much Brazil would gain if the country\n",
    "signed an agreement for a set of hypothetical dollar transfers per net\n",
    "ton of CO$_2$ captured. Our model output shows the overall social gains\n",
    "to reallocating production in the cross-section, including the option to\n",
    "preserve or enhance the Brazilian rain forest.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second step, we consider 78 sites, each of which is\n",
    "270km$\\times$<!-- -->270km. For this level of aggregation, we produce\n",
    "results that take into account stochastic changes in the price of\n",
    "agricultural output as well as, for comparison, deterministic results\n",
    "for this 78-site resolution. The results are quite close, showing that\n",
    "our stochastic representation of externally determined agricultural\n",
    "prices plays a minor role in the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Central to our analysis, we allow the productivities for carbon\n",
    "absorption and agriculture to be site-specific. Estimates of these\n",
    "crucial productivity parameters are subject to non-trivial uncertainty.\n",
    "Moreover, while we have cross-sectional data that are informative, these\n",
    "data do not give us direct measurements for the site-specific\n",
    "productivities. Instead, we use regression methods to provide the inputs\n",
    "needed for our analysis. Uncertainty in the regression coefficients\n",
    "induces uncertainty in the implied site-specific productivity\n",
    "parameters. The typical approach to uncertainty quantification explores\n",
    "such parameter uncertainty from the perspective of an external analyst.\n",
    "Instead, we incorporate this uncertainty explicitly into the decision\n",
    "problem of our hypothetical social planner. While it is appealing to\n",
    "address the parameter uncertainty probabilistically, there is ambiguity\n",
    "as to what probabilities to impose.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the third step, we explicitly consider parameter ambiguity from the\n",
    "perspective of the social planner. We again use the less refined 78-site\n",
    "partition of the Brazilian Amazon. We start with a baseline posterior\n",
    "distribution over site-specific productivity parameters for carbon\n",
    "sequestration and agricultural productivity implied by the regression\n",
    "estimation. While convenient, this baseline construction is *ad hoc* and\n",
    "uncertain. This leads us to engage in a sensitivity analysis that\n",
    "explores distributional sensitivity subject to penalization. This\n",
    "estimation is done prior to the decision-making of the social planner\n",
    "and so acts as “prior” when exploring alternative courses of action.\n",
    "Rather than fully embracing this distribution, the planner uses it as a\n",
    "baseline in a sensitivity analysis subject to penalization to ascertain\n",
    "which departures should be of most concern. The magnitude of a penalty\n",
    "parameter limits how much sensitivity is entertained and serves as the\n",
    "inverse of an ambiguity aversion parameter. For the computation of the\n",
    "optimal solutions, in this case of parameter ambiguity, we use the\n",
    "Markov chain Monte Carlo method based on Hamiltonian dynamics that we\n",
    "alluded to earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we assume that the planner can directly control deforestation, we\n",
    "view the solution to the planner’s problem as providing a benchmark for\n",
    "comparing the outcomes of alternative *ad hoc* policies, and suggesting\n",
    "improvements over current policies.[^5]\n",
